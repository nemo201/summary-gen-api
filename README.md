# Video Summary Generator

## Introduction
YouTube receives roughly 300000 individual video uploads each day,
amounting to 80k hours of video and 24TB of data. Similarly in
Facebook and Instagram roughly 95 million videos are uploaded every
day. To moderate/ filter this huge amount of videos the ML algorithms
use the video description provided by the users. But sometimes the
video description provided by the users are fake and not matching with
the video uploaded. This results in false recommendation of videos to
the users and sometimes may spread violence. Facebook hires
moderates who evaluates each and every videos manually and it’s been
noted that it also impact their lifestyle negatively. But if we are able to
generate a brief summary of the video then ML algorithms can be fed
with the textual data and the moderation / filtration process can be
automated. This project is not only limited to moderation of videos, it
can also be used by college/university students to generate summary of
video lectures.
Since all general meetings and teaching are becoming online in today’s
world and there are millions of videos generated everyday across the
world and tons of videos are uploaded in online platforms like Google,
Facebook, Instagram etc., the problem of filtering the videos becomes
difficult. Therefore this project aims at generating a summary of the
video with the power of NLP which can later be used by companies for
automatic sorting/ filtration of videos. This is not only limited to
business, students can also insert online lectures to the software and can
get a brief summary of video lectures which will be a great help for
them during their exams.
